# City Rule
## Rules
1. **Show Respect:** Treat others with kindness and consideration. Avoid any form of harassment, bullying, or intimidation towards fellow members. The primary purpose here is to enjoy ourselves, so if you find that your idea of fun involves ruining someone else's experience, this might not be the right place for you. If a member of the CAT or Staff Teams informs you that you've broken a rule, acknowledge it and refrain from arguing immediately. Engaging in arguments on the spot will only lead to a more severe punishment. Take some time to reflect on the situation, and if you believe it's necessary, you can submit an appeal on the forums. Failure to respect a staff member will result in a permanent ban from the server.
***
2. **Exploitation Policy:** Any attempt to utilise server resources in a way not explicitly intended by the development team may lead to an immediate and permanent ban without prior warning. If you encounter a bug or glitch, please report it promptly to the staff team via the forums to prevent any misunderstandings that could result in your account being banned. Additionally, rewards are available for those who provide valuable information to the development team. Common forms of exploitation include duplication glitches, bunny hopping, improper use of commands such as /IDS, and damage bugs.
***
3. **Age Restrictions:** Characters must be at least 18 years old unless granted explicit permission by an Admin. Additionally, all members are expected to conduct themselves with the maturity befitting adults. Failure to adhere to this expectation may result in removal from the server for being underage or lacking maturity.
***
4. **Reporting Player Misconduct:** If you suspect a player has violated a rule, there are two appropriate methods for reporting it. Firstly, utilise  the /ids command in-game to obtain the player's ID, then follow up with /report {their ID} {Details of misconduct}. Your report must provide specific details; reports stating "ADMIN TO ME" or "MY CAR BROKE" will be disregarded. Reports should solely pertain to reporting misconduct. Misusing this system may result in punishment. Alternatively, you can make a report via the forums. Failure to use either of these reporting systems, such as by direct messaging staff, will be considered a rule violation and may lead to punishment.
***
5. **Reporting Staff Misconduct:** Staff members are held to the same standards as all other members regarding rule compliance. If you believe a staff member has misused their privileges or failed to meet the expectations of an EF staff member, there is only one appropriate method for reporting such behavior: via the forums. Direct messaging staff, engaging in arguments with the staff member in question, or attempting to spread rumors or unrest about them will be considered a violation of Rule 1. The only exception to this rule is when your complaint pertains to an Admin; in such cases, you should directly contact Andy. It's crucial to ensure that you're certain the individual you're reporting is indeed an admin before reaching out to Andy. If the person doesn't have the admin tag, they are not an admin, and contacting Andy about them constitutes a breach of this rule. (Note: Mods are not admins)
***
6. **New Life Rule:** If your character is incapacitated (reduced to 0 health) during roleplay and a paramedic fails to arrive at the scene within 20 minutes to revive you, your character forgets all events leading up to their death. This includes details about organizations, who was involved in a robbery, and similar specifics. You cannot seek revenge or act upon any knowledge gained prior to your incapacitation. You must pretend not to recognize any identifying features of your assailant. This means refraining from contacting the authorities or attempting to pursue the perpetrator. Excuses such as "my friends told me" require you to disclose your friends' names to staff. If there's no evidence of your friends' presence or ability to relay information, they will also face consequences. In short, do not deceive staff, and if your character dies, focus on other activities.<br />
<br />
While a character is incapacitated, you are prohibited from robbing, kidnapping, or taking any hostile actions against them. This includes taking them to the hospital or loitering around the hospital with the intent of immediately resuming hostile interactions upon their revival. Once a character is killed, roleplay involving them ends, so if you intend to gather information or derive value from the interaction, refrain from killing them. Harassing or mistreating an incapacitated character further is also forbidden; once they are dead, it's time to move on.<br />
<br />
This rule does not prohibit you from being a good Samaritan and escorting someone directly to the hospital to avoid them waiting out their timer. However, you cannot immediately engage in hostile actions afterward. Additionally, police are allowed to transport injured or incapacitated suspects to the hospital before charging them. If your character is incapacitated and either teleported or transported to the hospital during roleplay, you must refrain from re-entering the area where the incident occurred until the current roleplay concludes. In roleplay, you can refer to this as experiencing PTSD. If you accidentally re-engage with the same roleplay scene, remove yourself from it as soon as possible. If your character is revived at the scene but not transported to the hospital, still remove yourself from the roleplay promptly.
***
7. **Mature Themes:** Sexual harassment, rape role-play, or any form of suicide role-play are strictly prohibited on the server. Given that most members are adults or young adults, it's essential to respect boundaries. If another player informs you that your comments are making them uncomfortable or unwanted, you have two options: cease the behavior and continue participating on the server or find another server. Staff will determine whether a reasonable person would recognize the inappropriateness of the comments. If you disagree with their decision, refer to Rule 1 for further guidance.
***
8. **Breaking Character:** Talking out of character within the city is not allowed unless explicitly permitted by staff and clarified as out of character. Regardless of context, if a staff member hears out-of-character communication, they reserve the right to enforce this rule.
***
9. **Metagaming:** Metagaming is strictly prohibited on the server, and if caught, you'll face harsher punishment regardless of your history. Metagaming refers to using any information that your character hasn't acquired through in-game roleplay within the city. This encompasses actions such as watching a stream, utilizing Discord communications instead of in-city radios or phones, or receiving information from another player without it being conveyed by their character. It's crucial to note that if you have multiple characters, they can never share information with each other, even through a third party. Staff will not entertain any excuses regarding this rule.
***
10. **Powergaming:** Powergaming occurs when unrealistic forms of roleplay are used to gain an advantage or when roleplay is refused altogether. For instance, if there's a room or vehicle wall between you and someone else talking, although you as a player can hear them, your character wouldn't, so you must ignore that information. Other powergaming violations include using third-person cameras to see things your character couldn't realistically see and coercing others into committing powergaming offenses, such as through the use of their menus.<br />
<br />
**Hostage Taking:** Police will not offer any financial or monetary advantage in exchange for hostages' lives, including the supply of weapons. However, hostages can be exchanged for other leverage from the police, such as preventing them from entering a building.<br />
<br />
**Player Robbing:** Under no circumstances can you rob another player unless there has been prior roleplay engagement. Additionally, you cannot rob them solely for monetary gain. Rush stealing from their boot or directly holding them up without prior engagement is not permitted. If you're found "chain robbing," staff will direct you to adjust your roleplay. Staff have the final authority in determining such violations.
***
13. **Fear RP/Valuing Your Life:** It's essential to assign value to your character's life. While you might desire your character to be fearless in all situations, EF does not permit such roleplay on the server. Valuing your life means exercising caution in-game to preserve your character's life, akin to real-life behaviors like checking both ways before crossing a road. On the server, this entails actions such as surrendering when a gun is drawn on you and you're unarmed, refraining from reckless driving or jumping off cliffs (claiming daredevil behavior is not a valid excuse), and avoiding unnecessary confrontations or shootouts (e.g., don't charge into them or obstruct them). Certain organizations may receive exemptions from this rule, allowing them to flee rather than risk capture (or loss of equipment) in specific situations. Staff will clearly communicate any exemptions granted to such organizations. It's imperative to consult staff before assuming you have an exemption, as doing so will not be accepted as an excuse.
***
14. **No Mic, No Play:** All members are required to use a microphone when playing in the city. If you are unable to use a microphone for a valid reason, such as a physical inability to speak, please submit a ticket on the forums explaining your circumstances. An exemption may be granted based on your explanation.
***
15. **Roleplaying Injuries:** In the event of being shot, involved in a crash triggering a script, falling from a significant height, or any similar scenario resulting in harm, it is mandatory to roleplay these injuries in a fair and realistic manner. This entails acknowledging any damage inflicted by a script, such as stating you are injured, experiencing screen blackout effects, or any other relevant effects. Simply stating "I need a revive" upon ambulance arrival is insufficient; additional effort is expected. "Respawning" mid-roleplay is not allowed. If downed and your respawn timer elapses while the roleplay continues, you must remain at the scene until revived by an ambulance officer, escorted to the hospital, or until the scene naturally clears. Minimizing the severity of injuries, such as emerging from a major accident or fall with only minor bruises or scratches, will result in punishment. The staff team holds the final authority in determining what constitutes reasonable injury, so careful consideration is advised.
***
16. **Random Death Match (RDM):** Attacking another player without engaging in verbal roleplay first is strictly prohibited. Killing another player should be considered a last resort; try initiating kidnapping, threats, or other roleplay scenarios first. Encourage creativity in your interactions. Failure to demonstrate that you attempted alternative forms of roleplay before resorting to killing may result in punishment under the RDM rule. Posting any form of kill montage in the EF Discord will be viewed as a violation of the RDM rule. Even if posted elsewhere, it may still affect your chances of whitelisting.
***
17. **Vehicle Death Match:** Utilizing your vehicle as a weapon is strictly forbidden on the server. This encompasses actions such as ramming individuals off bikes or repeatedly colliding with other vehicles. Encourage creativity in your roleplays. If you encounter hostile situations where someone is shooting at you, use your vehicle to flee the scene rather than engaging in attacks with it.
***
18. **Appropriate Vehicles:** The use of helicopters, planes, or other aerial vehicles is restricted unless part of your emergency service duties (such as HEMS, POLAIR, or Firehawk) or employment with a licensed air transit company (approved by admins). If you require an aerial vehicle for roleplay purposes, contact an admin (not a mod, CAT, or dev) and await confirmation. If there's any uncertainty regarding permission, refrain from using an aerial vehicle. This rule extends to tanks, APCs, or other specialized vehicles not typically accessible to regular citizens in Los Santos.

## Disclaimers
**Rule Updates:** These rules are subject to change over time. Please make sure to review them regularly for any additions or modifications.<br />
<br />
**Streaming Terms of Service:** EF cannot be held responsible for your compliance with the Terms of Service (TOS) of any streaming or hosting service you use.<br />
<br />
**Item Replacement Policy:** EF will not replace any items lost in-game due to theft, server restarts, or other issues. Refer to the new player FAQ on the forums for tips on preventing item loss. You can also find helpful keybinds for this in your F3 menu in-game under keybinds.<br />
<br />
**Administrative Approval:** When it is stated that you need admin approval, it means you specifically need approval from an admin. Approval from moderators, developers, or CAT team members will not suffice. Make sure to direct your requests to the appropriate team.<br />
<br />
**Outside Platforms:** Any EF-related forums, discords, or similar systems may require an EF staff team member to have access to all channels. This includes org discords or any platforms related to EF's operations. This measure ensures that server rules are upheld across all associated systems.<br />
<br />
**Vigilantism:** EF has a dedicated staff team. Any attempts to enforce server rules yourself, create drama, or publicly call out rule violations via Discord, OOC, etc., will result in punishment under rules 1 and 5. Remember, there are only two official methods to report misbehaviour Drama and vigilante behavior are not welcome in EF; this is a gaming community, not a platform for personal disputes. Come to play, share ideas, and leave the politics and drama behind.
