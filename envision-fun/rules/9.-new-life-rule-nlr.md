# 9. New Life Rule (NLR)

Under the New Life Rule (NLR), your character should forget the events leading up to their death unless revived by EMS. Characters, including police, sheriffs, and other government officials, should not expect you to recall these events. Do not return to the scene of your death or re-engage in the same situation until the roleplay has concluded. If a player is dead or downed, you must walk away and avoid interacting with them during the roleplay. This means no robbing, moving their body, or obstructing EMS. However, exceptions may apply, such as if a gang member is down and you need to get them to the hospital to avoid police detection. Remember, if EMS does not revive them, they will not retain any memory of the events leading up to their death.
