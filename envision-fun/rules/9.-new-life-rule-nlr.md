# 9. New Life Rule (NLR)

Remember this: You should forget the events that led to your character's death unless EMS revives you. Police, Sheriffs, and other Government Officials should not expect you to remember these situations. Do not return to the original scene of your death or get involved in the same situation until that roleplay has ended.

If a player is dead or downed, you must walk away and ignore them for the remainder of the roleplay situation. You must not rob a downed player, move their body, or hinder and obstruct EMS from assisting the individual. We understand that in some situations, this may not apply. For example, if your own gang member was downed by someone else, you are allowed to take them to the hospital to prevent the Police from finding them dead. Bear in mind that if EMS does not revive them, they will not remember anything leading up to their death.
