# 5. No Powergaming

Powergaming involves using unrealistic or unfair actions to gain an advantage in roleplay, such as escaping through impossible gaps, combat logging mid-RP, or using emotes to block others' actions. These behaviours break the flow of roleplay and diminish the game's realism and fairness. Always play within the limits of your character and the world, allowing for natural consequences and interactions. Avoid power gaming to ensure a more enjoyable and balanced experience for everyone.
