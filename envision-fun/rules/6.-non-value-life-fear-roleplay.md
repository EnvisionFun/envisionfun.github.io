# 6. Non-value Life / Fear Roleplay

In roleplay, showing fear and making realistic decisions in dangerous situations is essential. If your character is being threatened, especially at gunpoint, don't act recklessly or try to be a hero. Just like in real life, your character should value their life and try to find a way to survive or escape the situation. Ignoring danger or acting unrealistically takes away from the immersion and fairness of the game. Respect the consequences of the world around your character and play with authenticity.
