# 1. Be Respectful

Respect is fundamental in roleplaying. It means treating others with dignity and fairness, free from harassment, discrimination, or the use of racial slurs. Ensure that your in-character and out-of-character interactions are considerate and inclusive, fostering a safe and welcoming space for all players. Any highly offensive language or behaviour has no place in the game, and respect for individual differences is critical to maintaining a positive, enjoyable experience for everyone. You contribute to a healthy, respectful roleplaying environment by upholding these standards.
