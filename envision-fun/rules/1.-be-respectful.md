# 1. Be Respectful

Respect is fundamental in roleplaying, and it means treating others with dignity and fairness, free from harassment, discrimination, or the use of racial slurs. Ensure that your interactions, both in-character and out-of-character, are considerate and inclusive, fostering a safe and welcoming space for all players. Any form of offensive language or behaviour has no place in the game, and respect for individual differences is key to maintaining a positive, enjoyable experience for everyone. By upholding these standards, you contribute to a healthy, respectful roleplaying environment.
