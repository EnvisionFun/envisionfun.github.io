# 15. Reporting Staff

Staff members are held to the same rules as all players. If you believe a staff member is violating the rules, report the issue to an administrator through direct messages (DMs). For reports involving an administrator, contact Andy directly. If the report concerns Andy, please get in touch with Bryan via DM. Addressing any concerns about staff conduct is essential to ensure fairness and uphold community standards.
