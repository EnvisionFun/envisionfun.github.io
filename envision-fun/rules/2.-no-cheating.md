# 2. No Cheating

Do not cheat, hack, or exploit bugs in the game. Taking advantage of bugs or manipulating the system for personal gain disrupts the fairness and enjoyment of the roleplaying experience for others. If you encounter a bug, report it immediately rather than exploiting it. Any player caught cheating or exploiting bugs will face a ban. Play with integrity to ensure a fair and fun environment for everyone involved.
