# 4. No Metagaming

Do not use out-of-character (OOC) information to influence your in-character (IC) actions. Metagaming disrupts the flow of roleplay and undermines the immersion for others. Keeping IC and OOC knowledge separate is essential to maintain the story's integrity and ensure a fair, engaging experience for all players. Stick to what your character knows in the game world, not what you know outside of it.
