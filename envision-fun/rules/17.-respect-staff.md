# 17. Respect Staff

At the end of the day, our staff team comprises volunteers who dedicate time to making our community great and our server run smoothly. Please respect their decisions and authority. You don't have to agree with everything they have done, but please be respectful, do not make decisions in the city, and take it out on their characters. Remember, this is a roleplay game, and it is meant to be fun!
