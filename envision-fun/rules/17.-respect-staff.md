# 17. Respect Staff

Our staff team consists of volunteers who generously dedicate their time to maintaining and enhancing our community and server. Respect their decisions and authority, even if you donâ€™t agree with every choice they make. Avoid taking frustrations out on their characters or undermining their decisions in the city. Remember, this is a roleplay game designed for fun and collaboration. Respecting staff helps ensure a positive and enjoyable experience for everyone.
