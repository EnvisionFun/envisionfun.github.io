# 13. Have Fun

Roleplaying should be an enjoyable experience. If you’re not having fun, it’s worth considering why and making changes to improve your experience. Embrace the creative opportunities, engage with the community, and immerse yourself in the roleplay. Remember, the primary goal is to have a good time and enjoy the journey. If you’re having fun, it will positively impact your roleplay and that of others.
