# 7. No Random Deathmatch (RDM)

Do not kill other players without a valid roleplay reason. Random Deathmatch, or RDM, involves engaging in unprovoked violence or killing without proper context or justification within the roleplay. Such actions undermine the immersive experience and fairness of the game. Ensure that meaningful in-character motives and interactions drive conflicts or confrontations and that all actions contribute to the storyline rather than disrupt it. Play thoughtfully and respect the narrative and roles of others.
