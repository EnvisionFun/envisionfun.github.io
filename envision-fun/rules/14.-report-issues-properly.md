# 14. Report Issues Properly

Remember to use the correct channels to report rule violations. If it's a minor issue, you can start by reporting the situation in the city using /ids and /report, for example:

> /report 3 | Has VDMed me

If you feel that a moderator did not take action or if you need to report something more serious, please provide evidence by opening a ticket on Discord.
