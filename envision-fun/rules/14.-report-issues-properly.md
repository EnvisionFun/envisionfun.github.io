# 14. Report Issues Properly

Always use the designated channels to report rule violations. Use the in-city commands like /ids and /report for minor issues. For example:

> <mark style="color:green;">/report 3 | Has VDMed me</mark>

If you encounter a more severe issue or feel that a moderator's response was inadequate, provide evidence and open a ticket on Discord. This ensures that your concerns are addressed promptly and appropriately, maintaining the integrity and smooth operation of the roleplaying environment.
