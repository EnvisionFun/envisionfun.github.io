# 16. Ban Appeals

Please make all Ban Appeals through a support ticket and ensure they are done respectfully. We may not always make the right decision, but we would appreciate your respect in these situations. Only discuss your ban through a support ticket, as doing so in any other channel may result in being excluded from the Discord Server.
