# 16. Ban Appeals

Submit all Ban Appeals through a support ticket on Discord and ensure your appeal is presented respectfully. While we may not always make perfect decisions, we value your respectful approach in these situations. Only discuss your ban through the support ticket; addressing it in any other channel may lead to being excluded from the Discord server. This process helps us handle appeals efficiently and fairly.
