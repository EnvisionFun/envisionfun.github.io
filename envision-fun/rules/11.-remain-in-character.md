# 11. Remain in character

There are always situations that can surprise us or may offend us OOC. You should always remain in character at all times. An exception to that is if a member of staff is having a conversation with you and has indicated that it is an OOC conversation by starting the conversation with, "Hi, this is xxx from the Envision Staff Team". We will never break your roleplay situation unless we feel it is extremely necessary. Keeping within the roleplay scenario, it is important that your character remains safe at all times; this includes if you happen to go AFK. We recommend you find somewhere safe where your character will not be impacted by other RP whilst AFK or simply fly out.
