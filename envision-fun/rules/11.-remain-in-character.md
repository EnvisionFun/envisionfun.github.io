# 11. Remain in character

Always stay in character during roleplay, even in surprising or potentially offensive situations. The only exception is if a staff member explicitly initiates an out-of-character (OOC) conversation by stating, "Hi, this is \[Name] from the Envision Staff Team." We aim to preserve the integrity of your roleplay experience and will only break character when absolutely necessary. If you need to go AFK, ensure your character is in a safe location where they won't be affected by other roleplay actions. If your safety can't be guaranteed, consider logging out to avoid any disruption to your character's roleplay.
