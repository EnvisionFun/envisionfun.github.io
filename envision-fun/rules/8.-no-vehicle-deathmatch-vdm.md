# 8. No Vehicle Deathmatch (VDM)

Do not use vehicles to kill players randomly. Vehicle Deathmatch, or VDM, involves using a vehicle as a weapon to cause harm or death without a valid roleplay reason. This behaviour disrupts the gameplay and can negatively impact the experience for others. Ensure that any use of vehicles in your roleplay is realistic and justifiable within the story's context. Respect the boundaries of roleplay and avoid using vehicles to create unnecessary conflict or chaos.
